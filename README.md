# Getting Started

This project is a specialized fork of [maximegris/angular-electron](https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron), which is a great starting point for 
a new Electron application using Angular.

Use the instructions from [angular-electron](https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron) to get started with the initial install and build of this project. 

If you want to skip the ceremony and get dirty right away:
```
git clone https://github.com/recaf-io/angular-electron-aws.git
npm install
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm start
```
